Exploring 1-Bit LLMs for Low-Resource Sentiment Classification with Efficient Binary Inference
Abstract

    With the growing demand for deploying machine learning models in resource-constrained environments, 
    the application of 1-bit quantization to large language models (LLMs) emerges as a promising solution. 
    This paper explores the use of 1-bit LLMs for sentiment classification tasks, focusing on the trade-offs between 
    computational efficiency and accuracy. We investigate the potential of 1-bit quantization to significantly reduce 
    the memory footprint, inference time, and storage requirements of traditional models while maintaining competitive 
    accuracy in sentiment classification. We compare a full-precision model against a 1-bit model across various 
    performance metrics including inference time, memory usage, model size, and classification accuracy.
    
1. Introduction

    Sentiment classification, a fundamental task in Natural Language Processing (NLP), often involves 
    large-scale pre-trained models, such as BERT, that provide high accuracy but come with substantial 
    computational overhead and memory requirements. This presents a challenge for deploying such models in 
    resource-constrained environments like mobile phones, edge devices, and IoT systems.

    1-bit quantization, a technique that reduces the model weights to a single bit, offers a promising solution 
    to address these challenges. This study investigates the application of 1-bit quantized large language models 
    (LLMs) in sentiment classification tasks, particularly exploring how they balance accuracy and efficiency. By 
    compressing the model size and optimizing inference speed, 1-bit models have the potential to provide substantial 
    improvements in deployment efficiency without sacrificing performance.
    
2. Related Work

    Quantization techniques for neural networks, especially in the context of NLP, have been extensively researched 
    to reduce the memory footprint and improve computational efficiency. Recent studies have explored the benefits 
    of low-bit quantization for models like BERT, where 8-bit or 4-bit quantization has been applied with minor 
    reductions in accuracy. However, 1-bit quantization, which goes a step further by reducing weights to the binary 
    level, has been underexplored. In this study, we focus on the practical benefits and challenges of applying 
    1-bit quantization to LLMs for sentiment classification tasks.
    
3. Methodology

    Models Used:
    - Normal Model (Full-Precision Model): A baseline BERT-based sentiment classification model, trained using full 32-bit floating-point precision.
    - 1-Bit Model: A variant of the same model with 1-bit precision weights, implemented using standard 1-bit quantization techniques for neural networks.

    Task and Dataset:
    The models were evaluated on the IMDb dataset, a widely used benchmark for sentiment analysis. This dataset contains labeled movie reviews, categorized into positive and negative sentiment classes.

    Performance Metrics:
    The performance of both models was evaluated using inference time, memory usage, model size, and accuracy.

    4. Results and Discussion:
    - Inference Time: The 1-bit model showed significantly reduced inference times compared to the normal model.
    - Memory Usage: The 1-bit model demonstrated substantial reduction in memory consumption.
    - Model Size: The storage size of the 1-bit model was much smaller, making it suitable for deployment on devices with limited storage capacity.
    - Accuracy: The 1-bit model showed near-equal accuracy to the full-precision model.
    
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
5. Conclusion

    This study demonstrates the effectiveness of 1-bit quantization in improving the efficiency of large language models 
    for sentiment classification tasks. The 1-bit model offers significant improvements in terms of inference time, 
    memory usage, and model size while maintaining comparable accuracy to the full-precision model. These findings highlight 
    the potential of 1-bit models for deploying NLP tasks on resource-constrained devices, making them highly suitable for 
    applications in mobile devices, edge computing, and IoT.
